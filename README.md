## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Tailwind, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, EJS

Weeks ago I was involved in a project to make a blog. I had the job to do the backend of the project. Somehow unfulfilled after finishing it, as a fullstack developer I decided to make my own blog. So here it is, my own blog project!

## Optimizations
If I had more time, I would have introduced MVC architecture to the project.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. This was my first time working with tailwind, and I really enjoyed working with it.
